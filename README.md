# TamagotchiBase
Base repo for local version of Tamagotchi project

This repo will include the source code for the tamagotchi game. I decided to do this because trying to learn both C++ programming and web dev would be too much to balance while working a full time job.
Hopefully, this way I can still make progress but will have to manage and keep track of a lot less things.
